        <h1>Guitars</h1>
        
        <p id="one">I have lots of guitars. I started with a really bad Sears red guitar. My parents got it for me for Christmas when I was about 6. It couldn't stay in tune. But I was so bad when I first started strumming on a guitar, I didn't know any better. </p>
        
        <p id="two">When I was 13 I finally started trying to actually learn how to play. I then realized how bad a guitar that was. I saved up and got a Godin brand guitar. It's a Canadian brand and pretty good. That did me well for a few years.</p>
        
        <p id="three">Near the end of high school I got more serious and played a lot of shows with bands. I wanted something good a rugged because I played in loud bands and jumped around a lot. I went with a Fender Telecaster.</p>
        
        <p id="four">I've since also used a Gibson 335, and a Gibson SG very often. I'm on my second Telecaster as well, the first one was stolen while a band I played in was on tour. I also play a Gibson Dove acoustic guitar and a Taylor acoustic guitar as well. </p>
