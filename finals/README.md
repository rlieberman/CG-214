<h2>Final Project</h2>
The final project is either a personal portfolio site or a continuation of your midterm. If it's a continuation of your midterm, we <b>must talk before next week</b> to figure out how to take the midterm to the next level. We will go over the final project rubric in detail next week, but while conceptualizing your site, keep in mind the final should:
<ul>
<li>Have a fixed or liquid layout that's been considered</li>
<li>Utilize extensive media elements</li>
<li>Contain a degree of button/link transitions and/or CSS animation</li>
</ul>
I would like to not put a page minimum on the site, but it should be a <b>complete site</b> without dead links. So scale it appropriately for what you can achieve. You will be graded on the complexity of the project (i.e. if it's only one page, it better be complex and at least do a decent job of mimicking infinite scroll sites).
