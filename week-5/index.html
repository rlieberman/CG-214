<!--        Background paragraph-->
        <p>Since I was 13 and playing in <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/annakopsky/i-write-sims-not-tragedies?utm_term=.ucMMl2BVz#.pyWVl2NwX">really bad punk bands</a>, I have been experimenting with HTML. Design, and making things look good has never come easy to me, so even though I understood mark-up language, I tried to stay away.</p>

<!--        Grad school paragraph-->
        <p>But I went to grad school to make stories <b>interactive</b>, so I was going to learn to code! And I gravitated towards <a href="http://storyplex.io/">web-based projects</a>, so I had to get better at <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> to properly learn <b>JavaScript</b>.</p>
        
        <p>And now, here I am teaching people how to use it! And I hope to do a good job and make people <i>like</i> it. Since my learning has largely been focused on tackling what I need to know how to do in order to make an interactive project. It's been a learning experience for me to teach it from the ground up.

<!--        Info about Brackets-->
        <p>Learning a code editor is an important part of all of this, and using <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a> has been very fun. I installed an extension called <a href="http://emmet.io">Emmet</a>, and I'm starting to memorize shortcuts. For example, if I want to add a comment, instead of typing everything out, on a mac I can just do <i>command+forward slash</i>.</p>
