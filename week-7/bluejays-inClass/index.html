      The Toronto Blue Jays are literally the best team ever. I'm not a huge sports fan, but some of my oldest memories are watching the Blue Jays with my grandpa and my dad. I remember watching Dave Stieb's no hitter (the only one in Blue Jays history) at the family's summer cottage in 1990.

       They won the World Series in 1992 and 1993, but since then they've been pretty bad. Not really bad, and not really good. That resulted in the longest playoff drought of any team in any major North American sport.

        However, last year they finally won the Eastern division in the American League (sorry Yankees and Red Sox) and went to the playoffs. They made it to the League Championship series and lost to Kansas City.

        And this year, they made it to the wild card game against the Baltimore Orioles. They beat them in an exciting game, and then crushed the Texas Rangers in the Divisional Series. They face elimination against Cleveland, but they're not done yet!
